# JR / Spektrum / Futaba BuddyBox PPM Audio Driver

by Nicholas Robinson

## Overview

This driver allows a JR (Japan Remove Control Co., Ltd.), Spektrum (Horizon Hobby, Inc.) or Futaba (Hobbico, Inc.) radio transmitter to communicate with a PC (Windows / OS X / Linux). It is written in ANSI C, leveraging the excellent PortAudio Portable Cross-Platform Audio I/O library, and facilitates one-way communication from the radio transmitter to the PC via any available audio input device (microphone-in, line-in etc), using output from the transmitter's trainer port.

## Requirements

* Make
* cc/gcc
* PortAudio
* JR / Spektrum / Futaba Radio Transmitter with Trainer Port
* Trainer Cable
* Sound card with microphone-in / line-in

## Installation

    $ git clone git://github.com/nicholasrobinson/BuddyBox-PPM.git
    $ cd BuddyBox-PPM
    $ make clean && make
    
## Usage

### Execution

    $ ./BuddyBox
    
### Sample Output

    Initializing Buddy Box...
    
    (Plug in your transmitter cable: Tx first, line-in / microphone-in second)

### Sample Output Explanation

The above output indicates the raw output of 9 channels from my JR PCM9xII Tx, represented by the first 9 columns. The final column is an incremental sequential packet number.

# Notes

* You may need to change "PA_INPUT_DEVICE" in "PortAudioStream.h" to suit your audio input  device.
* You may need to tune "SAMPLE_RATE" in "PortAudioStream.h" to suit your audio input device. A higher sample rate will yield a higher resolution on each channel's output. For example 44.1kHz sample rate -> resolution of ~36 per channel, whereas 192kHz sample rate -> resolution of ~154 per channel
* Depending on your sound card's characteristics, you may need to tweak "BAD_PACKET_THRESHOLD" and "SAMPLE_NOISE_THRESHOLD" in "BuddyBox.h"
* Whilst this driver and the supplied "example" implementation could be used directly it is perhaps most usefully placed in a separate thread, sharing a pointer to "pas.signal", allowing real-time access to each channel's output. Examples coming soon...

Please let me know if you find this useful or come up with any novel implementations.

Enjoy!
